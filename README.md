# Description
The first change I did was I added an id to the div with a header of search optimization, I named the id 'search-engine-optimization'. I did this in order to make the link in the navigation bar take the user to a specific place in the webpage.

I then consolidated different selectors in the css stylesheet due to the same styles being applied to different elements.
