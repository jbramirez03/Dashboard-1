# Description
The first change I did was I added an id to the div with a header of search optimization, I named the id 'search-engine-optimization'. I did this in order to make the link in the navigation bar take the user to a specific place in the webpage.

I then consolidated different selectors in the css stylesheet due to the same styles being applied to different elements.

I changed the div with a class name of header into an actual header element and made the selector chang ein the css style sheet so no changes were made to the actual webpage.

I added an 'alt' attribute to all the image elements for accesibility purposes.

I then created a footer in the html in order to get semantic structure in the html and I also added an aide tag for the same purpose.

I lastly commented throughout the html document and the css stylesheet in order to explain the roles elements played in the website and what styles were being applied or what was being styled specifically.
